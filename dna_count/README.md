# DNA nucleotide count chart using Streamlit


DNA Nucleotide count is a data app that counts the nucleotides for a given DNA sequence.
NA sequences are combinations of  A (adenine), T (thymine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine).The app usesthe Streamlit library to create a web app that displays the comparison charts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Version of python used - Python 3.7.4

## Installing DNA Nucleotide count app

To install the project, the following packages are needed:

1. pip install streamlit
3. pip install pandas

## Using DNA nucleotide count

Run the following command to see the price and Volume comparisons between <stock1> and <stock2>

```
streamlit run dna_count.py
```
The DNA sequence can be entered into the text box on the Streamlit webpage follwed by Control+Enter keys to apply. The resulting dataframe with the count of the nucleotides are displayed aloing with a histogram of the nucleotide frequencies
